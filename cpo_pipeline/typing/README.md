# CPO Pipeline Phase 2: MLST Typing, Plasmid Analysis

## Requirements

The `typing/pipeline.py` script requires the following conda environments:

 - `mlst-2.15.1`
 - `mob_suite-1.4.5`


Note: An abricate database containing carbapenemase gene sequences must be prepared before running the pipeline. (todo: provide details on how to build that db)

### Setup

This module uses outputs from [Module 1 (Assembly & QC)](https://github.com/Public-Health-Bioinformatics/cpo-pipeline/tree/master/cpo_pipeline/assembly). That module must be run first before running this one.

### Submit Analysis

TBD
